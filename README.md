#Python Password Manager project
- This is an early project for developing a password manager with python
- This program worked initially as a command line interface password manager but eventually I will develop it into a full GUI program using TKINTER
- This program would need an initial main password that would be stored on a txt file on the desktop(initially developed for windows). (in another later version of the program I will hide this file somewhere in the shared data folder and salt & hash the passwords stored)
- This program would also store other input passwords along with other useful user info 
- This program would have also been used to generate new passwords, right now though it is in the initial random pin stage
